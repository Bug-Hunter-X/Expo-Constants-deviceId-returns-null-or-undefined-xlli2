# Expo Constants.deviceId Returns Null or Undefined

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using `Constants.deviceId` in Expo applications.  On certain devices or emulators, this value might be `null` or `undefined`, leading to unexpected application behavior or crashes.  The solution provided implements a fallback mechanism to generate a unique ID if `Constants.deviceId` is unavailable.

## Problem

The `Constants.deviceId` property in Expo is designed to provide a unique identifier for a device. However, there are scenarios where this ID may be missing or not available.  This often happens with emulators or in situations where the device's unique identifiers are not properly configured.

## Solution

The solution included in this repository offers a robust approach to handle cases where `Constants.deviceId` returns `null` or `undefined`. It provides a fallback mechanism to generate a pseudo-unique ID by combining the device's other identifiers and creating a hash. This ensures that you'll always have a reliable way to identify the device, regardless of whether `Constants.deviceId` is available.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run `expo start` to start the development server.
5. Test the application on different devices and emulators.
